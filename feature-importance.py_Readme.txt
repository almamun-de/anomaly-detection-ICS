This Python script, "feature-importance.py" is designed for assessing and visualizing the importance of features in classification models. It supports various Multi-Class Classifiers, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM, to analyze feature importance based on permutation importance. The script can handle different training and testing scenarios and uses cross-validation for more robust results.

Required Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Usage:
The script requires a CSV file containing the dataset, with features prefixed as 'feature' and a 'label' column. It also requires specifying the training/testing scenario and the number of folds for cross-validation.
Use a generated CSV file from pca or autoencoder feature extraction.


Command Line Syntax:
python feature-importance.py -f /path_to_csv_file.csv -s [scenario] -k [kfold]


Output:
Bar plot images for each classifier and scenario, saved in a directory named 'feature_importance_plots'.
