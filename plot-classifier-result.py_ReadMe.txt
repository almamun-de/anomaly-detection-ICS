This Python script, named "plot-classifier-result.py" is designed to evaluate and visualize the performance of a classification model. It reads a CSV file containing predicted and actual labels, calculates key classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score), and generates a bar plot to visually represent these metrics.

Required Libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Usage:
To use this script, you need to have a generated predicted CSV file from a classifier.

Command Line Syntax:
$ python plot-classifier-result.py -f path_to_csv_file.csv


Output:
A bar plot image file showing the calculated metrics for the given classifier result CSV file. The PNG file is saved in the same directory as the CSV file.
